## 2025-11-24
Company specs commited to git at commit 39974951a46643d4c9947a6a4698bdb95347612d
Website we like:
1 headspace headspace.com
2 poketo https://www.poketo.com
3 Adaline https://www.adaline.ai

Website we dislikes:
1 playpokpok https://playpokpok.com
2 retool https://retool.com
3 spline https://spline.design

Basically the websites that I like have these features:
- easy to grasp separation of sections whether it be by using space, lines or colors
- got some variety of movements that still can go well together
- kinda fluid, as in no sharp edges. I just feel comfortable browsing
