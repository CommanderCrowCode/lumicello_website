            REVIEW CRITERIA:
            1. Security - No exposed secrets, XSS vulnerabilities, or unsafe practices
            2. Code Quality - Clean, readable code following project conventions
            3. Functionality - Changes work as intended, no obvious bugs
            4. Build Safety - Changes won't break the build script or deployment

            REVIEW PROCESS:
            1. Use `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` to see the changes
            2. Analyze the changes against the criteria above
            3. Check CLAUDE.md for project conventions if needed

            DECISION:
            - If changes are safe and acceptable: APPROVE the PR
            - If there are issues that MUST be fixed: REQUEST CHANGES
            - Be lenient on style preferences, strict on security and bugs

            ACTION:
            Use `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` with one of:
            - `--approve --body "Your approval message"`
            - `--request-changes --body "Issues found: ..."`

            Keep feedback concise and actionable.
