### Visual Metaphor: The Tree of Development

```

            YEAR 2   /  |  \   DOMAINS
                    /   |   \
                   / YEAR 1  \
                  /     |     \
                 /      |      \
           ─────────────────────────
                    ROOT
              "Every child grows"

| Confetti | Birthday section | 3s | Physics-based |

### Scroll Behavior

| Technique | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|

### JavaScript Requirements

```javascript
// lumibox-scroll.js

// 1. Scroll Progress Tracking
// - Track overall page scroll progress
// - Calculate per-section progress

// 2. Intersection Observer Setup
// - Reveal animations for content
// - Trigger phase transitions

// 3. Tree Animation Controller
// - Map scroll progress to tree growth stages
// - Update SVG paths/transforms

// 4. Sticky Element Management
// - Handle pinned visuals
// - Release at section boundaries

// 5. Background Color Transitions
// - Smooth color shifts between phases
// - Use CSS custom properties

// 6. Confetti Animation (Birthday)
// - Canvas-based particle system
// - Triggered at celebration section

// 7. Domain Orbs Interaction
// - Hover/focus effects
// - Click to expand (optional)
```

### Performance Considerations

1. **Use CSS transforms only** - Avoid layout-triggering properties
2. **Debounce scroll handlers** - Limit calculations per frame
3. **Lazy load images** - Load as sections approach viewport
4. **Preload critical assets** - Hero images, tree SVG
5. **Use `will-change` sparingly** - Only on animated elements
6. **Test on low-end devices** - Ensure smooth 60fps

### Browser Support

| Feature | Fallback Strategy |
|---------|-------------------|
| Intersection Observer | Polyfill or show-all |
| CSS Sticky | Static positioning |
| CSS Custom Properties | Pre-compiled values |
| SVG Animations | Static tree image |
| Canvas (confetti) | CSS-only celebration |
